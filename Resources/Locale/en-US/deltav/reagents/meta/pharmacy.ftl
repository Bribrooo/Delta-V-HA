reagent-name-vicodilicaine = Vicodilicaine
reagent-desc-vicodilicaine = Used to treat moderate to severe pain to the head. Most of the time is taken by mouth. Recreational use is common due to its hallucinogen properties. Discouraged to pair with other strong painkillers, antidepressants, and anxiety medication, though totally safe with alcohol.

reagent-name-asparatine = Asparatine

reagent-name-zepprocane = Zepprocane
reagent-desc-zepprocane = A high-quality barbiturate, used as an anxiolitic and anticonvulsant medicicine. From its complex form, it goes along well with antidepressants and alcohol, but is incompatible with most painkillers.

reagent-name-cordivol = Cordivol
reagent-desc-cordivol = An α1 antagonist, non-selective β-blocker. Used in severe cases of systolic heart failure. No real issues with mixing other drugs, alcohol is safe.

reagent-name-debivolol = X-Debivolol
reagent-desc-debivolol = placeholder script.
